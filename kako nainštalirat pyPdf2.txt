To install setup.py files under Windows you can choose this way with the command line:

hit windows key
type cmd
excute the command line (black window)
type cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\pyPDF2 to go into the directory where the setup.py is (this is mine if I downloaded it) The path can be copied from the explorer window.
type dir now you should see the name setup.py in the listing of all contents
type C:\python27\python.exe setup.py install I use Python2.7 here. Use C:\python33\python.exe setup.py install for python 3.3 and so on. You can follow these instructions now if you wish: http://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html
Another way, that does not show when there are problems, is:

create a shortcut to setup.py
open the properties of the shortcut. There should be a path like this: C:\Users\User\Downloads\pyPDF2\setup.py (this is where my setup.py is)
you modify that path in the following way:

"C:\Users\User\Downloads\pyPDF2\setup.py" install
The " are important if you have white spaces in the path name

click OK to save the modifications to the setup.py - shortcut
double-click the setup.py - shortcut.
In all cases you may need to restart your python to be able to import the module.

When you do this feel free to post your solution also with pictures for other newbies looking for it.
